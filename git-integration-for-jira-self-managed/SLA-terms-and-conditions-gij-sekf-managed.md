## Support Exceptions & Limitations

GitKraken is committed to resolving issues promptly and professionally, in alignment with our Service Level Agreements (SLAs). However, certain requests fall outside the scope of our standard support.

**This SLA does not cover:**

- **Product training**
- **Support requests for licenses that are not covered by an active License Maintenance agreement**
- **Customers using the app beyond [stated usage limits](https://help.gitkraken.com/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/gij-standard-vs-advanced/)** 
- During troubleshooting, we may recommend upgrading to a different edition of Git Integration for Jira if usage exceeds the limits defined for your current plan.

## Platform Compatibility & Customer Responsibilities
To ensure optimal support, GitKraken follows [Atlassian's official End of Life (EOL) policies](https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-support-end-of-life-policy-201851003.html) and expects customers to maintain compatible environments.

**Self-Managed Jira (Data Center)**
GitKraken’s support policy aligns with Atlassian’s EOL guidelines for self-managed Jira. Atlassian supports each feature version for two years after its release, and GitKraken extends support for at least the same duration. In some cases, we may support older Jira versions when technically feasible.

Refer to the [Atlassian Marketplace Versions Page](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira/version-history) for official version compatibility details.

**Jira Cloud**
For Jira Cloud, GitKraken adheres to Atlassian’s deprecation and support timelines. We monitor and adapt to changes in Atlassian’s platform to ensure continued compatibility and support.

**Note**: For both cloud and self-managed environments, ensure that your Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches and application features.
