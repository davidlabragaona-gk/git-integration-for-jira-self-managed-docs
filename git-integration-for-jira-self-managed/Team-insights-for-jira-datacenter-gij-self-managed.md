The Team Insights for Jira DC extension equips team managers with the tools to effectively track comprehensive git history and monitor Jira team activities across various projects, epics, and sprints. This functionality allows team leaders to efficiently prioritize tasks, identify potential risks, reveal patterns, and enhance decision-making when overseeing Jira team workflows and activities.

Team Insights for Jira (TIJ) provides team managers with a comprehensive overview of their team's activities and progress. This allows managers to pinpoint any items that may be at risk based on the team's operation.
