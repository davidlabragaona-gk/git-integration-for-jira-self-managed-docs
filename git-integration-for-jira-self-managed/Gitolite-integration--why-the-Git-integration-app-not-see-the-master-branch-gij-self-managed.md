<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->

### Problem

After creating a new bare repository and integrating it to Jira Server via Git Integration for Jira app, I'm not able to see the last changes I made which contains smart commit tags thru the Repository Browser.

&nbsp;

### Diagnosis

The following criteria are true:

*   Repositories are located on the same Linux machine as Jira.
*   Repositories are connected through the "Tracked folder" feature.
*   A user has made commits locally and pushed them to their Jira + git server.
*   The Git Integration app shows "No commits" message and "Branch does not exists" errors.
Solutions

It appears that the issue is really in the permissions of the files. Check them by manually updating the permissions of the files to proper values and reindex the repository via the Git Integration app.

Set the **UMASK** setting as mentioned in [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15082590/git-object-folder-permission](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15082590/git-object-folder-permission).

For gitolite and git repository on the same server as Jira, set the UMASK value in .gitolite.rc file to the following:

```
From UMASK => 0077
To UMASK => 0027
```
